Homework 5 is in HW_5_Group9.ipynb file.

Procedure:

Since the accuracy/feature must be greater than 0.45 we ran the random forest for 1 and 2 features.
We then edited the estimators between 1 and 100 to determine the number of estimators that would return the best accuracy and meet the requirement of greater than 0.45 accuracy/feature.


Results:

Number of features:  1

accuracy: 0.968390001552554

accuracy / number of features: 0.968390001552554

estimators : 36
